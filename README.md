#Sales Data Analysis
This project applies SQL to analyze sales data and extract meaningful insights. The focus is on identifying patterns such as top-performing products, revenue trends, and customer behavior. As the project is still in progress, additional queries and deeper analysis will be added over time to enhance its scope and findings.
